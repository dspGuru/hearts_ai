Hearts card game implementation.

Standard rules:
- 3 or 4 players
- 4 players: 52 cards, 13 cards each
- 3 players: 51 cards (2♦ removed), 17 cards each
- Pass 3 cards (rotation varies by player count)
- 2 of clubs leads first trick (or 3 of clubs in 3-player if 2♦ removed)
- Must follow suit if possible
- Hearts cannot be led until broken
- Hearts = 1 point each, Queen of Spades = 13 points
- Shooting the moon: take all hearts + QoS = 0 points, others get 26
- Game ends when a player reaches 100 points
