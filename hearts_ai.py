PASSING STRATEGY
----------------
pass_queen_of_spades:      {w.pass_queen_of_spades:6.1f}  (Priority to pass QoS when unprotected)
queen_protection_threshold:    {w.queen_protection_threshold:3d}  (Low spades needed to keep QoS)
pass_to_void_suit:         {w.pass_to_void_suit:6.1f}  (Priority to void a short suit)
void_minor_suit_bonus:     {w.void_minor_suit_bonus:6.1f}  (Extra priority for voiding clubs/diamonds)
pass_high_hearts:          {w.pass_high_hearts:6.1f}  (Priority to pass high hearts)
high_heart_threshold:          {w.high_heart_threshold:3d}  (Min rank for "high" heart, 10=Ten)
pass_high_cards:           {w.pass_high_cards:6.1f}  (Priority to pass A/K/Q of other suits)
high_card_threshold:           {w.high_card_threshold:3d}  (Min rank for "high" card, 12=Queen)
pass_base_priority:        {w.pass_base_priority:6.1f}  (Base priority + rank for any card)

LEADING STRATEGY
----------------
lead_clubs_priority:       {w.lead_clubs_priority:6.1f}  (Priority to lead clubs)
lead_diamonds_priority:    {w.lead_diamonds_priority:6.1f}  (Priority to lead diamonds)
lead_spades_priority:      {w.lead_spades_priority:6.1f}  (Priority to lead spades after QoS gone)
lead_hearts_priority:      {w.lead_hearts_priority:6.1f}  (Priority to lead hearts after broken)
lead_low_card_preference:  {w.lead_low_card_preference:6.1f}  (Multiplier favoring low cards)

DISCARDING STRATEGY
-------------------
discard_queen_of_spades:   {w.discard_queen_of_spades:6.1f}  (Priority to dump QoS)
discard_hearts:            {w.discard_hearts:6.1f}  (Priority to dump hearts)
discard_dangerous_spades:  {w.discard_dangerous_spades:6.1f}  (Priority to dump A/K spades)
discard_high_cards:        {w.discard_high_cards:6.1f}  (Priority to dump other high cards)
discard_rank_multiplier:   {w.discard_rank_multiplier:6.1f}  (Rank contribution to discard score)

FOLLOWING SUIT STRATEGY
-----------------------
high_duck_preference:      {w.high_duck_preference:6.1f}  (Prefer high cards when ducking)
low_win_preference:        {w.low_win_preference:6.1f}  (Prefer low cards when must win)
take_safe_trick_preference:{w.take_safe_trick_preference:6.1f}  (Preference for taking point-free tricks)

MOON DEFENSE
------------
moon_threat_threshold:         {w.moon_threat_threshold:3d}  (Points to suspect moon attempt)
moon_block_priority:       {w.moon_block_priority:6.1f}  (Priority boost when blocking)
